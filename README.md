Project Overview
In this project, I delved into the task of predicting spam messages using two popular machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. Through this process, I gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

What I Did
Data Exploration:

Loaded the spam dataset and explored its structure using Pandas. I created a DataFrame and began by examining the initial rows to understand the data better.
Preparing the Data:

Labels and Features:
Extracted the spam column as labels (y), which indicate whether a message is spam or not.
Constructed the feature set (X) by dropping the spam column from the DataFrame.
Splitting the Data:
Divided the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing) to ensure that the model could be evaluated on unseen data.
Scaling the Data:

Applied StandardScaler to standardize the feature values, which is crucial for models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to perform optimally.
Training and Evaluating Models:

Logistic Regression:
Trained the Logistic Regression model on the scaled training data and evaluated it on the test set.
Achieved an accuracy score of [insert accuracy here]. Saved and reviewed predictions to understand the modelâ€™s performance better.
Random Forest Classifier:
Trained the Random Forest model on the same training data and evaluated it similarly.
Achieved an accuracy score of [insert accuracy here]. Predictions were saved and analyzed.
Comparing Results:

Compared the accuracy of both models to determine which performed better. The Random Forest Classifier [outperformed/was comparable to/underperformed] the Logistic Regression model with an accuracy score of [insert accuracy here] compared to [insert accuracy here].
Key Takeaways
Model Performance: The Random Forest Classifier generally provided [better/similar/less] accuracy compared to Logistic Regression. This was insightful in understanding how different models handle the task of spam detection.
Data Preparation: Scaling and splitting the data were crucial steps to ensure that the models were trained and evaluated properly.
Future Work: There are always opportunities for improvement, such as tuning hyperparameters, exploring other models, or incorporating additional features to enhance performance.
Files Created
logistic_regression_predictions.csv: Contains predictions made by the Logistic Regression model for further review.
random_forest_predictions.csv: Includes predictions from the Random Forest Classifier model.
This project not only reinforced my understanding of model training and evaluation but also highlighted the importance of thorough data preparation and analysis.
